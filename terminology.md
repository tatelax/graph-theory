# Terminology

**Conjecture** - A statement that is being proposed to be true

**Theorem** - A statement that can be shown to be true

**Axiom (or postulate)** - Statements that we assume to be true

**Lemma** - A less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of theorems

**Corollary** - A theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that has been proven

**Parity** - Whether or not a number is odd or even

**Degree** - The number of edges with that vertex as an end-point

**|V|** - Total # of vertices

**|E|** - Total # of edges

**Size of Graph** - |E|

***Sum of Degrees of Vertices Theorem*** *(Handshaking Theorem)* - Total degree of a particular graph = 2|E|

> The total degree of a graph is even

> In any graph, there are an even number of vertices of odd degree

**Adjacent** - Two edges that are connected by an edge || Two edges that share a vertex

> A loop causes a vertex to be *adjacent* to itself

**Incident** - An edge is incident on its end points
